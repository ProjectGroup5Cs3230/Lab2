 * Lab 2 - Create an application with 'Student' and 'Group' objects based on the CS 3230 Summer 2015 class. This project
 * should populate a conversation between all of the students in a group and should run through (once) each group's
 * conversations.  Each student has five conversation greetings. Each student takes a turn outputing a greeting to the
 * console until each of the student's five greetings have been written to the console.
